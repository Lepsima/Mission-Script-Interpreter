# Mission Script Interpreter
A custom language for quickly designing the behaviour of NPC's and objects in game missions.
<br>

It's currently very WIP and specific to my needs and may not be suitable for other projects.

#

The goal is to provide easy control of what the NPC does at any point, reacting to events, alternative routes, mission checkpoints, etc.
It compacts C# routines and functions into something simple, while avoiding visual languages and rebuild times.

It also allows players to change the behaviour of the NPC's with a decent balance of ease and functionality.
